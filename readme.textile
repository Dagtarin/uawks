h1. Fork of UAWKS Unofficial Apple Wireless Keyboard Support for Windows 

Original source: http://code.google.com/p/uawks/
Original readme in OrigReadme.txt

this fork is just UAWKS with some (probably raw) features I personally needed

You need latest http://www.autohotkey.com/ installed to run it (run UAWKS.ahk)

h1. Changes from original UAWKS

* Both Cmd and Ctrl mapped to Ctrl (with exception to Cmd-Space and Cmd-L, see below)
* Eject key mapped to Insert key
* CapsLock mapped to Win key (I never used CapsLock in the my whole life - so it's good key to remap)
* Alt-Space is mapped to Ctrl-Shift, which means that is you have Windows with Ctrl-Shift as keyboard layout change sequence you can change layout the same way as you do it on Mac (also I think Alt-Space is more comfortable)
* Cmd-Space is mapped to Alt-Space - to work with Launchy (setted to Alt-Space shortcut) the same way as you launch applications on Mac with Spotlight
** We need such remapping in UAWKS because Launchy that I used to start apps can't itself use Win(Cmd)-Space on Win7 due to Windows internal mappings

h1. Problems

* No solution to Cmd(Win)-L problem - Windows always blocks desktop on this shortcut
